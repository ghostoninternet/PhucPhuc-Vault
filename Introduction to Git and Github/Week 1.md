# Version Control System
Version Control System (VCS): Keeps track of the changes we made to our files
We can make edits to multiple files and treat that collection of edits as a single change, which is commonly knowns as a **Commit**

Git has a distributed architecture: every person contributing to a repository has full copy of the repository on their own development machine. Git official website: git-scm.com

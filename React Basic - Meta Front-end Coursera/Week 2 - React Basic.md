# Dynamic events and how to handle them
>The process by which the HTML button communicates to the JS event handler to execute some code and respond to the event action is known as **triggering**.
>
>In **React code**, events are handled using **JSX event attributes**, which are very similar to HTML event attributes. Example:
>			`<HTML>onclick` = `<JSX>onClick`
>Event groups:
>* Clipboard events
>* Composition events
>* Keyboard events
>* Mouse events
>* Selection events
>* Touch events
>* Wheel events
>* Animation events
>* ... and more !

## Event handling and embedded expressions
>There are different ways to embed expressions in event handlers in React:
>- With an inline anonymous ES5 function
>- With an inline, anonymous ES6 function (an arrow function)
>- Using a separate function declaration
>- Using a separate function expression
>

## JavaScript
>1. "Plug into" HTML element on which to listen for an event.
>2. Use `addEventListener` method on the document object.
## React
> In React, the rule is to avoid manipulating the DOM directly as much as possible. You should set everything up declaratively, meaning you describe the updates to React and let it figure out the rest. This is best done using event attribute, one-to-one mapping between HTML event attributes and JSX event attributes, but note that there is **no function invocation syntax**. Instead, you should **pass a reference to the event handling function** without invoking it. For example:

```HTML
<button onclick="handleClick()"> Click me </button>
<script>
	function handleClick() {
		console.log("Clicked!")
	}
</script>
```

```JavaScript
function Btn() {
	const handleClick = () => console.log("Clicked !")
}
return(
	<div>
		<button onClick={handleClick}> Click me </button>
	</div>
)
```

> One more feature only using React is the passing of function declarations as props.

# Data and Events
>The advantages of utilizing a centralized point of data - a **"single source of truth"**:
>1. It offers a more efficient way of working when data frequently changes.
>2. It reduces the possibility of typing errors in your code.
>3. It allows you to edit multiple items from a single point.![[parent_child_data_flow_React.png]]
>
>In React, data flow is a one-way street. Sometimes it's said that the data flow is unidirectional. Put differently, the data in React flows from a parent component to a child component. The data flow starts at the root and can flow to multiple levels of nesting, from the root component (parent component) to the child component, then the grandchild component, and further down the hierarchy.
>
>Props are immutable (cannot be changed).
>
>The two main benefits of this unidirectional data flow are that it allows developers to:
>1. comprehend the logic of React apps more quickly andÂ 
>2. simplify the data flow.
>
>Having data move through props in only one direction makes it simpler to understand the logic of how the components interact. If data were moving everywhere, all the time, then it would be much harder to comprehend its logical flow. Any optimization you tried to implement would likely not be as efficient as it could be, especially in modern React.

### Why is one-way flow in React is important ?
>1. Ensures data is moving from top to bottom through the component hierarchy.
>2. Changes are transmitted through the system.

>All data in React can be divided into **props data** and **states data**:
>**props data**: Data outside the components that it receives and works with but can't mutate.
>**state data**: Data inside the components that it controls and can mutate.

## Hooks
>One **key benefit** of hooks is that they solve the problem of unnecessary code reuse across components.
>
>**HOOKS**: functions that let you hook into **React state** and lifecycle features from components.
>`useState` **hook**: this hook is used to manage the state within a component and keep track of it.
>	1. Import the **useState** `import React, {useState} from 'react'`
>	2. Declare a **state variable** `const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)`
>	3. Provide any name `const [showMenu, setShowMenu] = useState(false)` 
>		The `useState(false)` return a pair which is an array with two items.
>Calling **useState** will do two things:
>1. Create a state variable with an initial value --> `showMenu` that represents the current state
>2. Creates a function to set that state variable's value --> `setShowMenu`, this function is used to update the value of `showMenu` by passing Boolean value to it `setShowMenu(true)`
>**useState** hook should be called at the top level of your component. You can use this hook to track any kind of data: string, number, arrays, Booleans or objects.
>
>Hooks also come with a set of rules, that you need to follow while using them:
>1. You can only call hooks at the top level of your component or your own hooks.
>2. You cannot call hooks inside loops or conditions.
>3. You can only call hooks from React functions, and not regular JavaScript functions.

## State
>State is data in a component that determines behavior. State is important because it allows components to stay in sync with each other and ensure that your app behaves as intended.
>
>In React, state is kept in a state of variables. The main way to change State is to alter these variables.
>![[component_state.png]]
>Component can be **Stateful** or **Stateless**.

## Managing State
>**Lifting State Up**: Lifting state up is about cutting the state from the child component and moving it to the parent component's code, with the intent of making the state available in sibling components.
>
>**Prop drilling**: prop drilling is a situation where you are passing data from a parent to a child component, then to a grandchild component, and so on, until it reaches a more distant component further down the component tree, where this data is required.

## Context API
![[contextAPI_props.png]]
>**Context API** provides a streamline way to work with context in **React**
>
>Context Provider: Components that stores the state.
>Context Consumer: Components that will use the state.

## Stateful vs Stateless
>**Stateful**: hold state as the internal data, the state changes based on the way the app is built, often is the user interaction. Use stateful when: **State must be maintained to work**.
>**Stateless**: doesn't store state, any changes must be inheritance through props. Use stateless when: **State not needed to work.**

# Dynamic events and how to handle them
>The process by which the HTML button communicates to the JS event handler to execute some code and respond to the event action is known as triggering.
>
>In **React code**, events are handled using **JSX event attributes**, which are very similar to HTML event attributes. Example:
>			`<HTML>onclick` = `<JSX>onClick`
>Event groups:
>* Clipboard events
>* Composition events
>* Keyboard events
>* Mouse events
>* Selection events
>* Touch events
>* Wheel events
>* Animation events
>* ... and more !
